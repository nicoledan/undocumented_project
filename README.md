Title: Undocumented
Description beneath title: Undocumented immigrants made up 3.4% of the U.S. population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. This game will help you understand their everyday experiences.

You decided to come to the US for a better life. According to Pew Research, one in three Mexicans would migrate to the US in 2009, due to crime, economic problems, illegal drugs, and corruption.

1. Do you try to "wait in line" to get permission to come to the US?
  a. yes
  b. no

Explanation after choice: According to the American Immigration Council, there is no line. Undocumented immigrants often do not have the connections to get a visa based on employment, family reunification, or humanitarian protection.

2. Your children are eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals, a program that allows children who came to the US under the age of 16 before June 15, 2012 to "defer action against an individual for a certain period of time." This will also allow them to apply for work permits. The cost of the application is $465.
  a. yes
  b. no

Explanation after choice: Undocumented immigrants who are enrolled in DACA are able to get jobs, internships, driver's licenses, bank accounts, credit cards, and healthcare, according to the American Immigration Council Website. However, it does have to be renewed every two years, which will cost $465.


3. Undocumented immigrants cannot buy health insurance under the affordable care act, according to HealthCare.gov. You get sick. If you go to the doctor, you will have to pay the full cost and might have to show documentation. What do you do?
  a. Go to the doctor
  b. Postpone going to the doctor

Explanation after choice: According to PBS, undocumented immigrants often under-utilize healthcare services - "if undocumented immigrants undergo any major health problems, they're often not discovered until (those problems are) more sever and more costly, and the patient could have a worse prognosis."

End screen:
As an undocumented immigrant, there are many services and opportunities that are unavailable to you. To learn more about this, please see the resources below:
(here I will link to all the websites I used)

I decided that there will be no way to win - because this issues is a little more complex than the income inequality issue in Spent.
