Title: Undocumented
Description beneath title: Undocumented immigrants made up 3.4% of the U.S. population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. This game will help you understand their everyday experiences.

You decided to come to the US for a better life. According to Pew Research, one in three Mexicans said that they would migrate to the US in 2009, due to crime, economic problems, illegal drugs, and corruption.

1. Did you try to "wait in line" to get permission to come to the US?
  a. yes
  b. no

Explanation after choice: According to the American Immigration Council, there is no line. Undocumented immigrants often do not have the connections to get a visa based on employment, family reunification, or humanitarian protection.

2. Did you bring your children with you?
  a. Yes
  b. No

NOT ABLE TO MAKE 2a-2B RUN YET (will need switch statement). Select NO to go through rest of questions.

if yes, 2a

2a. Your children are eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood arrivals, a program that allows children who came to the US under the age of 16 before June 15, 2012 to "defer action against an individual for a certain period of time." This will also allow them to apply for work permits, but it also means registering with the government, potentially giving information that could aid in deportation. The cost of the application is $465. Do you apply?
  a. yes
  b. no

Explanation after choice: Undocumented immigrants who are enrolled in DACA are able to get jobs, internships, driver's licenses, bank accounts, credit cards, and healthcare, according to the American Immigration Council Website. However, it does have to be renewed every two years, which will cost $465.

2b.  Your child's DACA is about to expire as a president who opposes DACA is elected. He could deport anyone who has DACA, since they have given their information in order to apply. Do you renew your child's DACA?



3. Undocumented immigrants cannot buy health insurance under the affordable care act, according to HealthCare.gov. You get sick. If you go to the doctor, you will have to pay the full cost and might have to show documentation. What do you do?
  a. Go to the doctor
  b. Postpone going to the doctor

Explanation after choice: According to the study "Undocumented Immigrants and Health Care Reform", Latino immigrants tend to have a better health status than people who are born in the US, however when they arrive they may have to deal with other factors that that take away their health advantages, including fears of deportation (Berk and Schur 2001; Hacker et al. 2011). Any conditions that undocumented immigrants do have "may be allowed to progress without detection or treatment due ot significant barriers to health care access (Achkar et al. 2008; Coritsidis et al. 2004; Dang, Giordano and Kim 2012)."


4. You get into a car accident. What do you do?
  a. be honest with the other driver, and ask them not to report to insurance
  b. drive away
Explanation: Unless you live in one of 12 states that allows undocumented immigrants to have a driver's license, not having one could potentially put you at risk for deportation. According to procon.org, undocumented immigrants are able to get drivers' licenses in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.

I decided that there will be no way to win - because this issues is a little more complex than the income inequality issue in Spent.
