  <p>Your children are eligible for <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca" target="_blank">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)</a>, a program that allows children who came to the U.S. under the age of 16 before June 15, 2012 to "defer action against an individual for a certain period of time." This will also allow them to apply for work permits, but it  means registering with the government. The cost of the application is $465. Do you apply?</p>

There is a lot of uncertainty about what could happen: all DACA recipients could have their DACA revoked or they might be allowed to keep it until it expires. DACA recipients would not necessarily be at a higher risk of being deported if the program is terminated. </p>

Any conditions that undocumented immigrants do have "may be allowed to progress without detection or treatment due ot significant barriers to health care access (Achkar et al. 2008; Coritsidis et al. 2004; Dang, Giordano and Kim 2012)."</p>
